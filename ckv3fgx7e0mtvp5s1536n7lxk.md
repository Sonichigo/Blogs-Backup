Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹, If you are following me on my LinkedIn you might know that I joined SAWO Labs as a Developer Champ. And I have complete 1 month as it's a team member.

I will be sharing my learning and insights about my experience in this blog. If you would like to follow me through my 3 months journey, you can consider signing up on my newsletter on my profile so that you get notified when I share my learning and experience.

## What all i didðŸš€

1. First thing i did after joining was played with SAWO SDK, implementing them in my projects, providing feedback and feature request as after all primary i am SAWO Developer champ firstðŸ˜‚.

- There were few beginners, who got stuck after creating the project and was unable to move on with the project, so stepping up, helped them and guided till the integration was successful.

- As SAWO Labs are sponsors to many great hackathons, i was selected as a mentor for those from SAWO Team. This undoubtedly helped me on personal basis as well as professional interaction, as i got see the techstack works with which i wasn't that much familiar yet, while solving queries got to learn those from many brilliant hackers.

- There are many new developers, who might the SAWO Labs works interesting but due to the skills are not able to implement those in their work, to help such new beginners i took the sessions, made videos, etc.. to help them understand how simple the things are and very easily those can be done.

I really believe when there's opportunity to learn, grow, and collaborate, one should never miss that. As this thought of mine has provided me with such a place were we are always asked to reach out in case we need any help or anything which needs to be discussed.
