Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹, If you are following me on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sonichigo) you might know that I joined SAWO Labs as a Developer Champ. And I have complete 1 month as it's a team member.

To be honest, I still can't believe that a month has passed so quickly. It has been a lot of fun and collaboration.

Okay, I will be sharing my learning and insights about my experience in this blog. If you would like to follow me through my 3 months journey, you can consider signing up on my newsletter on my profile so that you get notified when I share my learning and experience.

Okay so let's get started.

# My Learning ðŸš€.

I joined team on 08/2021, but before getting diving into the how much i got to learn and improve upon, first thing we had after joining was the orientation - the best orientation in all and every program. There we discussed things like:
- What is program about
- What we will be doing
- Any shoutouts as the Days passed on I became comfortable. Yes in a week I felt like I belong here for a long time. I really like communicating with other teammates. Listening to their ideas, telling your ideas fearlessly, speaking up more. [Anuj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anujsharma378/), [Meghna](https://in.linkedin.com/in/meghna-das15) & [Cherish](https://in.linkedin.com/in/cherishsantoshi) kept on telling us that don't feel left out. If you want to speak about something just do it. I personally feel like the current team is like perfectly matched puzzle blocks. We laugh at jokes ðŸ˜‚, share ideas ðŸ’¡, thoughtsðŸ¤”, etc.

We are given the opportunity to learn, grow. We are always asked to reach out in case we need any help or anything which needs to be discussed.
