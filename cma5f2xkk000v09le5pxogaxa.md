Attending **Open Source Summit Europe 2024** in Austria as a speaker has been one of the most rewarding milestones in my professional journey. I got to represent our work, engage with a passionate developer’s community, and exchanging ideas and plan collaboration with some of brightest people in open source was nothing short of phenomenal.

This summit was more than just a speaking engagement; it gave an opportunity to place myself in the enthusiasm , ever-evolving world of open source, and witness firsthand the momentum that the global open source community is building together.

## 📍 The Experience as a Speaker

I had the honor of delivering a session focused on “**How to Generate Test-Cases and Data Mocks for Microservices at Kernel Using eBPF**“, where I spoke about how we can easily record the API calls of any user-level application at Kernel using an eBPF program and convert those to realistic test cases and data mocks/stubs without writing any scripts. How we can set our testing pipelines on auto-pilot and how we can integrate this pipeline in popular language native testing libraries like JUnit, Jest, and Go-Test and easily achieve high test coverage on functional test suites. The response from the audience was encouraging, and post session we discussed the pros and cons of the “ebpf tracing“, and how we got an chance to build something to resolve a common problem with less to no frictions.

Delivering this talk in a room filled with developers, maintainers, DevRel professionals, and open source advocates was both humbling and energizing. The level of curiosity, critical thinking, and camaraderie made the summit feel like a homecoming for builders who speak the same language - open source.

## 🤝 Meaningful Interactions

One of the most fulfilling aspects of OSS EU was the diversity of attendees and the deep technical and strategic conversations I had with professionals from leading companies shaping the future of tech. I had the privilege of engaging with teams from:

### 🔶 AWS

Conversations revolved around cloud-native tooling, open governance in OSS projects, and long-term sustainability in community-led innovation. [**Mohammed Fazalullah**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammedfazalullah/overlay/about-this-profile/)**,** shared about cdk8s in nutshell.

### 🟦 SUSE

SUSE’s commitment to enterprise-grade open source solutions continues to inspire. I discussed community adoption strategies, and it was enriching to hear their take on evolving Linux ecosystems.

### 🟠 ARM

With ARM’s growing influence we ended up talking about architecture portability and OSS optimization was a technical treat. The new and most fascinating I got to learn about was “[**ARM’s Developer Program**](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program)“. It was great to meet [**Ross Burton**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossburton/)**,** and [**Sandra Hermoso Rodriguez**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-hermoso-rodr%C3%ADguez-526910173/)

### 🟡 Permit.io

We delved into access control challenges in modern apps and how open policy agents are reshaping developer-first security. Their openness to community feedback was refreshing.

### 🟣 GitLab

Discussing DevOps, documentation standards, and contribution workflows with GitLab’s team reminded me of the immense value of dogfooding and community-influenced product design. [**Abubakar Ango**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abubakarango/overlay/about-this-profile/) shared about the “GitLab AI Agent“ that can be directly added to your workflow to automate various software development lifecycle tasks.

### 🔵 Intel Open Source

Intel’s OSS Drive showcased some groundbreaking initiatives. We spoke about hardware-software co-design, and it was amazing to see how deeply they’re investing in upstream contributions - [OPEA](https://opea.dev/).

## ✨ Conclusion — Beyond Talks & Tech

OSS EU 2024 wasn’t just an event; it was a **celebration of collective growth**. I return with renewed inspiration, a stronger network, and a deep sense of gratitude for being part of this evolving ecosystem. My sincere thanks to the organizer, fellow speakers, and every attendee who made OSS EU 2024 unforgettable.

> Here’s to more code, more collaboration, and more community. *See you all at the next one!*
