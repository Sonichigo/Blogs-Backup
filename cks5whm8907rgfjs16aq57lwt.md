### Got to do in the Program!

Talking about my experience at LGM-SOC’21, it was great being here. Initially, I had no idea of what Open Source means but slowly and steadily I came to know about the same and started contributing towards the projects. It was like taking part in Hacktoberfest, there were multiple projects to work on. And a great team of Mentors and Admins who, whenever need were right aside with us. 

I contributed to a single project Daily-Coding-DS-ALGO-Practice by Ayush Kumar. I started contributing to the project. Also to the [Web-dev-mini-projects](https://github.com/Ayushparikh-code/Web-dev-mini-projects) by Ayush Parikh where i submitted the web app made on the React, It was a great experience for me contributing to both the projects.

Although LGM-SOC’21 is over now, my learning with them hasn't.
